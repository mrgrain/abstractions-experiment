    "With the current L2 Constructs, all feature abstractions are enclosed within the respective Construct. Take a `Topic` as an example: The L2 includes an abstraction to help with FIFO Topics. It codifies the dependency between some low-level CFN properties and the topic name having to end in `.fifo`. This abstraction is currently *only* available to users of the L2. If I want to use this feature, I *have to* use the L2. This is problematic in scenarios where users are interested in *some*, but not *all* of the features of an L2.\n",

These Constructs do not have a representation in the physical or logical world. They only exist as nodes in the construct tree.

What they are is a container that holds one or more `CfnElement`, and that is what the framework is looking for when synthesizing your App. Anything that's not implementing the `CfnElement` contract (it uses a Symbol), will be ignored. So the only new thing we are introducing with *Virtuals* is that different subtrees will be interested in different types of Constructs. For a `Dashboard` it would be `Widget`s and `Variable`s, and `Widget`s itself might be interested in `Metric`s."

    "Once we have a virtual Construct tree, we can lean into it further on put even more things on it. 'What's left?', you ask. The modifiers themselves. There are many different ways we can approach a syntax for this. The main point of contention with this approach is that for a Construct to be a Construct, we need to provide a *scope* and a *identifier*. Imagine this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "new AddHornModifier(stack, 'AddRainbowHorn', {\n",

    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It works, but is *very* verbose. Good news is, I believe we can strongly reduce the verbosity of Modifier-Constructs. First of all, if every Modifier operates on a subject then we already have our scope. Modifiers are now attached to the subject they are changing. The second part is the identifier. Let's take a step back and ask ourselves why we even have `id`s? A part of the answer to this is, that CFN templates require unique *Logical Ids* and they must be stable. While are other benefits to having unique Id paths in Construct Tree, this is a fundamental one that cannot be 'engineered away'. With Modifiers (and *Virtuals*) we don't have this constraint. There are fathomable scenarios where stable Construct Ids are useful, but on a whole they are simply not required. Enter `Auto Id`s. We can just generate ids for modifiers (algorithm tbd) and call it a day. Most benefits will remain and complexity goes away.\n",
