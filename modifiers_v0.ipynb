    "# Introducing: Feature modifiers\n",

    "With the current L2 Constructs, all feature abstractions are enclosed within the respective Construct. Take a `Topic` as an example: The L2 includes an abstraction to help with FIFO Topics. It codifies the dependency between some low-level CFN properties and the topic name having to end in `.fifo`. This abstraction is currently *only* available to users of the L2. If I want to use this feature, I *have to* use the L2. This is problematic in scenarios where users are interested in *some*, but not *all* of the features of an L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind feature modifiers is to break-out these abstractions from being tightly coupled to an L2. They should be usable with any `Topic`, or - going even further - with any Construct tree that includes `n` `Topics` (with `n >= 1`)."
